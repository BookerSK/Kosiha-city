# Kosiha-city
There is the game-exersise for Python(pandas, sql, numpy, aiogram)

To start "City" you should run admin_panel.py
Then you have to enter command "Generate" to create a log of citizen. This will create csv file in "citizens" (I really hope that I'll make it in sqllite3 one day)
Another commands can interact with city. You can make your own citizen: Game -> Create or continue game with any existed citizen. 
Without creating any citizen this program doesn't make any sense:)

Also you can run a bot in telegram. Running the bot allows real players run commands like Game -> Cont, so they can set action to citizen or they can see city statistics.
